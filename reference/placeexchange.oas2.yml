  version: 3.10.0
  description: "## Implementation Notes\n\n<details><summary>Request Limits</summary>\n<p>\n\nThe maximum size of a single request is 6MB. If sending data greater than that - you should split your transmission into multiple requests.\n</p>\n</details>\n\n## Conventions\n\n<details><summary>Authentication</summary>\n<p>\n\nAuthentication tokens can take a variety of forms (username, password, apiKey, certificate, one-time credentials) but will resolve to a given `user` entity, which is used for identification within the platform.\n\nFor more information on obtaining access tokens to submit to protected API endpoints, see: [/api/token/](/api/authentication/posttoken)\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Authorization</summary>\n<p>\n\nAuthorization is Organization-based. Orgaizations are arranged in a flat structure, and users may have access to multiple organizations. Most entities are rooted in organizations.\n\nAuthorization is a 2 phase process based on OAuth. Access tokens (or other credentials) will be resolved to:\n\n**User Principal** - representing the caller to a service. A principal could represent many actors:\n\n*  an individual person logging into an application\n*  a web or mobile application accessing Place Exchange APIs\n*  a service integrated for data transfers\n*  a screen or other device offering advertising inventory for bidding \n\nUser principals will also be used to look up:\n\n* **Orgs**: a principal belongs to or hase access to (e.g. `pub1`, `pub2`)\n* **Roles**: what operations a principal can perform in those organizations: `read`, `write`, `admin`. A user may have multiple roles (e.g. `read` and `write` in the same Org)\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Entity Conventions</summary>\n<p>\n\nPluralization:\n\n* pluralize entity collections (e.g. books vs. book)\n  * root entities in pluralized collections (e.g. /tolstoy/books/war_and_peace)\n\nAll entities should possess:\n* `id`: an internal Place Exchange-assigned unique identifier (UUID) for an object. `id` values are globally unique across all objects, and are the permanent, canonical identifier for any object in the system.\n* `owned_by` - Reference to an `org`.`id` that owns the entity and can grant access to it.\n* `name`: an externally referencable, and typically provided reference for objects. `name` fields are expected to be unique within an organization, for a particular entity type (e.g. `adunit`) but are *not&* expected to be globally unique - thus their usage must typically be qualified with both an organization reference, as well as an entity type\n* `ts` - Unix-timestamp recording when an entity was first created\n* `created_by` - `user.id` that created an entity\n\nMutable entities should possess:\n* `modified_by` - `user.id` who last modified an entity\n* `modified_ts` - Unix-timestamp recording when an entity was last modified\n* `archived` - If an entity supports \"soft-deletes\", denotese whether or not an entity has been archived. `null` or `false` indicate active obects. `true` indicates an archived object. By default, archived objects will not be returned as results from collections, and requests to an archived object will return HTTP 404 responses.\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Pagination</summary>\n<p>\n\nOperations returning multiple entities support optional pagination. If no `page` parameter is provided, the API will attempt to return all entities which a user is eligible to view.\n\nIf a `page` parameter is provided on a request URI (e.g. `&page=2`\n* Results will be returned in pages of 1000 items.\n* If an invalid page number (e.g. non-integer, negative integer) is provided then the paramter will be ignored and all objects will be returned\n* If the page number exceeds actual number of pages then last page will be returned\n* If the last page is less than a complete set (e.g. 456 vs. 1000) only the remainder will be returned\n\nThe preferred way of generating requests for pages is to use the `Link` header, as the format and behavior of pagination may change in the future. An example of Link values for `/adapprovals` includes:\n\n```\nLink: <http://localhost:8000/api/v3/adapprovals?page=1>;rel='first',<http://localhost:8000/api/v3/adapprovals?page=1>;rel='prev', <http://localhost:8000/api/v3/adapprovals?page=3>;rel='next', <http://localhost:8000/api/v3/adapprovals?page=12>;rel='last'\n```\n\n:info:\n* This tag will show up only if Query parameter 'page' is used\n* Previous and Next \"Link\" tags will be also provided in respose headers, and are preferred vs manually constructing query strings\n* Currently, if records are inserted while you are retrieving then the page offset/contents may change\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Filter/Query</summary>\n<p>\n\nSome operations currently support filter/query on a handful of specific attributes via URL parameters.\n\nA more general approach to be finalized in 3.0-GA\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Sorting</summary>\n<p>\n\nTo be finalized in 3.0-GA\n\n</p>\n</details>"

                      Number of impressions that was sent to the DSP and used as the number of record for the transaction. This may be different from the `imp_x` sent on the `/adrequests` or `/webpages` call from the publisher in 2 ways:

                      1. Non-integer impression estimates per-slot will be rounded to match DSP requirements for integer numbers of transactions, with a floor of 1.
                      2. Non-approved, or non-audited publisher-provided measurement providers may have their estimates capped

                      The value of this field should be used for any yield calculations or budget accumulation done by the publisher

Note: while the returned ad will fit within the region defined on the request, it may not cover the entire screen region, and will not be surrounded with content. If completely filling the screen region is required, callers should consider [/webpage](./paths/)\n\n**Response Format** - `AdRequest` calls may optionally include a `format` parameter which the client can use to specify a particular format for ad delivery. This parameter allows 2 possible options:\n\n* `json` (default) return a custom JSON-format. This format provides richer information about creative meta-data as well as pricing information\n* `vast4` return a VAST 4.0 document. This document will include an <Impression> reference to /plays for recording playback, it is expected that this pixel will be called one time when the ad is played. (see sample Responses for more detail)\n  * If a video creative is the winning bid, the creative information will be returned in-line in the VAST document as a <Creative> element, with no wrappers\n  * If a IAB-formatted display creative is the winning bid, the creative information will be returned as a PNG, JPG, or GIF referenced as a URL inside a <NonLinear> element.\n\nGenerally the `json` format is preferred, but VAST is provided for backwards compatibility with video-only players.\n\n**Response Status** - Responses to valid `AdRequest` calls containing `creative` will also contain a `status` field indicating the source of the demand, and whether it is a paid impression, or part of a deal that may contain other payment terms (e.g. `prepaid`, `house`, `bonus`).\n\n**Creative Caching** - `creative` objects represent a specific, reviwed version of ad copy and associated metadata. They include both inline markup (typically HTML5, or a VAST file) as well as a unique identifier. Creatives and referenced media files may be cached indefinitely (though some kind of max-age or LRU mechanism is recommended, particularly for on-device caching) as changes to the creative or it's metadata will result in the creation of a new `creative` entity, with it's own unique identifier.\n\n**Auction Type** - Auction type may be set at multiple levels (e.g. at the AdRequest level for Open Auctions, or alternatively on specific deals). Both 1st and 2nd price auctions (`at` 1,2) are supported for Open Auctions, with `at` = 3 (fixed-price auctions) also supported within the context of `deals`.\n\t\n**Open Auction** - To submit an Open Auction `AdRequest` omit the `deals` key or set `private_auction` to 0.  Note: the `AdUnit` and `Network` also must not contain any `deals` attributes otherwise the bid request exposed to programmatic bidders will inherit `deals` from `AdUnit` and/or `Network` and will subsequently send a Private Auction bid request.  When an `AdRequest` is designated for Open Auction, PlaceExchange will add on curated deals based on adunit attributes.  "

      description: "Notify Place Exchange of an upcoming opportunity to show an ad, to expose to programmatic bidders for auction.\n\nRetrieves ad content, surrounded with generic \"filler\" content to match the complete region of the screen. If clients want to control how to completely fill the screen region is required, callers should consider [/adrequest](./adrequest/)\n\n**Response Format** - `Webpage` calls may optionally include a `format` parameter which the client can use to specify a particular format for webpage delivery. This parameter allows 2 possible options:\n\n* `html` (default) return an HTML representation of the web page intended to be directly rendered in a browser-like environment\n* `json` return a custom JSON-format. This format provides richer information about creative meta-data as well as pricing information, wrapped around the HTML markup provided in the `html` format\n\nGenerally the `json` format is preferred, but HTML is provided as the default to simplify testing in web clients.\n\n**No-bid Status** - Responses from auctions is configurable. \n\n* `200` (default) if no add is returned, a `HTTP 200` response is returned, with a no-ad version of the selected template (if available)\n* `204` if a `nobid` status of 204 is requested, `/webpage` requests not resulting in a bid will return an empty `HTTP 204` response. This is designed for scenarios where the caller is a rich-client, or server-side middleware capabile of making alternative decisions, or conducting a secondary auction\n\n**Caching** - `webpage` responses can be cached.  The `webpage_cache_key` contains a unique identifier for the webpage content that will change when the content is determined to be stale.\n\n**Auction Type** - Auction type may be set at multiple levels (e.g. at the AdRequest level for Open Auctions, or alternatively on specific deals). Both 1st and 2nd price auctions (`at` 1,2) are supported for Open Auctions, with `at` = 3 (fixed-price auctions) also supported within the context of `deals`\n\n**Open Auction** - To submit an Open Auction webpage request omit the `deals` key or set `private_auction` to 0.  Note: the `AdUnit` and `Network` also must not contain any `deals` attributes otherwise the bid request exposed to programmatic bidders will inherit `deals` from `AdUnit` and/or `Network` and will subsequently send a Private Auction bid request.  When a webpage request is designated for Open Auction, PlaceExchange will add on curated deals based on adunit attributes.  "

        Returns template markup as an HTML document, with parameters replaced, and relative links

        **Variables**: Variables are expected to be included as path parameters, based on the template being called.

        example: `GET orgs/a2baca36-48c4-452e-9aa1-bc86a6fc5cff/templates/sample/replace?variable1=value1;variable2=value2`

        To load the html and css properly for templates, a wrapper html is created, in which the source markup is added in an iframe through javascript. The response contains the wrapper html also, along with the template markup. Browser displays the template markup with replaced path parameters passed in request.

        Expected Zip Layout:
        1. Template markup file (index.html). This contains the variables which will be replaced based on the path parameters in the request.
        2. If any javascript or styling is required to load the template markup, those should be included in zip along with index.html.
        3. .zip is the supported extension.

        The endpoint allows a user to retrieve an access token to submit for further API actions.

        **Rate limiting**: If a user enters their password incorrectly more than 10 times from a single IP address, they will be blocked from logging into that account from that IP address. If a user attempts to login 20 times per minute as the same user from the same location, regardless of having the correct credentials, the rate limit will come into effect. When this happens, the user can make 10 attempts per minute.
